### About

Our aim here is to provide an overview of various <i>geometries</i>. The most familiar geometry for most of you, <i>Euclidean Geometry</i>, can be seen as a prototypical example &mdash; Geometry concerns itself with the study of shapes: points, lines, polygons, conics, etc. This semester we will take a tour of various geometries: Euclidean Geometry, Affine Geometry, Projective Geometry, and (time permitting) Hyperbolic Geometry.

In this course, we will adopt the perspective &mdash; associated with Felix Klein in modern mathematics &mdash; that to understand a <i>geometry</i>, all one need do is understand its <i>symmetries</i>. To this end, we will also be discussing some basic group theory, so as to give us a language to describe symmetry transformations.
