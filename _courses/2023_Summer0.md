### About

This course is meant to serve as a reminder of some old topics, and an introduction to new ones. Equally importantly, it will provide you a chance to get to know your graduate cohort, and get used to working together. Currently, the plan is to review point-set topology, explore the fundamental group, and then move on to topics from analysis and differential topology. What precisely we will discuss will change depending on interest and background, and I will try to be flexible as we move between topics. The course notes above will be updated as often as possible to reflect what we actually do in class.
