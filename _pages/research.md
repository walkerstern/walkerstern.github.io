My research deals with higher category theory, homotopy theory, and applications to topology and mathematical physics. I am particularly interested in topological field theories, $$(\infty,2)$$-categories, higher operads, and 2-Segal objects. See my [publications]({{site.url}}/publications/) page for further details. 

### Selected ongoing projects

- Relations between cyclic 2-Segal sets/spaces and double categories. Joint with [Julie Bergner](https://sites.google.com/view/julie-bergner/)
- Frobenius algebras in (higher) categories of spans or lagrangian correspondences. Joint with [Ivan Contreras](https://icontreraspalacios.people.amherst.edu/) and [Rajan Mehta](https://www.smith.edu/people/rajan-mehta)
- Models for cyclic $$\infty$$-operads, algebras over cyclic $$\infty$$-operads.
