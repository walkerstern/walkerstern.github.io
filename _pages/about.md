I am a postdoc in the research group of [Cihan Okay](https://www.cihanokay.com/) at Bilkent University. Before that, I was an RTG post-doctoral research associate and lecturer in mathematics at the University of Virginia, and a post-doc at Universit채t Hamburg. I received my doctorate in mathematics from Universit채t Bonn in 2019, advised by [Tobias Dyckerhoff](https://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/home/dyckerhoff/). 

My work deals with $$(\infty,1)$$-categories, $$(\infty,2)$$-categories, homotopy theory, operads, mathematical physics, and topology. For more details, see my [research]({{site.url}}/research/) and [publications]({{site.url}}/publications/) pages. 

I have taught at the Wentworth Institute of Technology, Universit채t Hamburg, and the University of Virginia. Archived webpages of my teaching at UVA are available on my [teaching]({{site.url}}/teaching/) page.
