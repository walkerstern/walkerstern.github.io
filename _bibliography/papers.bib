      We introduce a theory of twisted simplicial distributions on simplicial principal bundles, which allow us to capture Bell's non-locality, and the more general notion of quantum contextuality. We leverage the classical theory of simplicial principal bundles, as well as structures on categories of such bundles, to provide powerful computational tools for analyzing twisted distributions in terms of both direct constructions in simplicial sets and techniques from homological algebra. We use these techniques to analyze our key examples: quantum distributions and operator-theoretic polytopes used in the classical simulation of quantum computation.

We carefully unpack the definition of O-monoids in the 2-categories of discrete fibrations and of category-indexed sets. Using the classical Grothendieck construction, we thereby obtain an O-monoidal Grothendieck construction relating lax O-monoidal functors into Set to strict O-monoidal functors which are also discrete fibrations. },

These results connect closely with work of the third author on $A_\infty$ algebras in $\infty$-categories of spans, as well as the growing body of work on higher Segal objects.

	abstract = {In this thesis we analyze 2-dimensional open topological field theories in both 1-categorical and $\infty$-categorical contexts. Making use of the formalism, introduced by Dyckerhoff and Kapranov, of graphs structured over a crossed simplicial group \(\Delta \mathfrak G\), we give combinatorial models for 2-dimensional open cobordism categories with additional structure ‚Äî orientations, $N$-spin structures, etc. We then use this model to effect a classification of the corresponding classes of 1-categorical topological field theories. This classification retrieves, in special cases, a number of results known in the literature, as well as providing new results.
	
	 We then turn to 2-dimensional open oriented topological field theories valued in an $\infty$-category \(\operatorname\{Span\}(C)\) of spans in an $\infty$-category $C$. Applying a theorem stated by Lurie in [33], such topological field theories are classified by Calabi-Yau algebras in \(\operatorname\{Span\}(C)\). We define two 1-categories whose functors to $C$ parameterize, respectively, associative algebras and Calabi-Yau algebras in \(\operatorname\{Span\}(C)\). We prove that there is an equivalence of $\infty$-categories between associative algebras in Span(C) and 2-Segal simplicial objects in $C$; and we prove an equivalence of $\infty$-categories between Calabi-Yau algebras in \(\operatorname\{Span\}(C)\) and 2-Segal cyclic objects in $C$. We discuss the invariants the resultant topological field theories assign to surfaces, and develop the example provided by cyclic structures on Cech nerves.},

Our definition is formulated using the language of marked biscaled simplicial sets: Those are scaled simplicial sets equipped with an additional collection of triangles containing the scaled 2-simplices, which we call lean triangles, in addition to a collection of edges containing all degenerate 1-simplices.  We prove the existence of a left proper combinatorial simplicial model category whose fibrant objects are precisely the 2-Cartesian fibrations over a chosen scaled simplicial set $S$. Over the terminal scaled simplicial set, this provides a new model structure modeling $\infty$-bicategories, which we show is Quillen equivalent to Lurie‚Äôs scaled simplicial set model. We conclude by providing a characterization of 2-Cartesian fibrations over an $\infty$-bicategory. This characterization then allows us to identify those 2-Cartesian fibrations arising as the coherent nerve of a fibration of \(\operatorname{Set}_\Delta\)-enriched categories, thus showing that our definition recovers the preexisting notions of fibred 2-categories.},
