	abstract={In this work, we conclude our study of fibred $\infty$-bicategories by providing a Grothendieck construction in this setting. Given a scaled simplicial set $S$ (which need not be fibrant) we construct a 2-categorical version of Lurie's straightening-unstraightening adjunction, thereby furnishing an equivalence between the $\infty$-bicategory of 2-Cartesian fibrations over $S$ and the $\infty$-bicategory of contravariant functors <a>\(S^\{\text o\text p \}\to {\mathbb B\text i\text c\text a\text t}_\infty\)</a> with values in the $\infty$-bicategory of $\infty$-bicategories. We provide a relative nerve construction in the case where the base is a 2-category, and use this to prove a comparison to existing bicategorical Grothendieck constructions.

The main result of this paper is a characterization of cofinal functors of $\infty$-bicategories via generalizations of the conditions of Quillen's Theorem A. As a key ingredient for the proof of our main theorem we produce for every functor of $\infty$-bicategories \(f: {\mathbb C} to {\mathbb D}\) an outer 2-Cartesian fibration \(\mathbb F ({\mathbb C})\to {\mathbb D}\) which we identify as the free fibration on the functor $f$.</a>},

	html = {https://bonndoc.ulb.uni-bonn.de/xmlui/handle/20.500.11811/8081},
	abstract = {In this thesis we analyze 2-dimensional open topological field theories in both 1-categorical and $\infty$-categorical contexts. Making use of the formalism, introduced by Dyckerhoff and Kapranov, of graphs structured over a crossed simplicial group \(\Delta \mathfrak G\), we give combinatorial models for 2-dimensional open cobordism categories with additional structure — orientations, $N$-spin structures, etc. We then use this model to effect a classification of the corresponding classes of 1-categorical topological field theories. This classification retrieves, in special cases, a number of results known in the literature, as well as providing new results.
	
	 We then turn to 2-dimensional open oriented topological field theories valued in an $\infty$-category \(\operatorname\{Span\}(C)\) of spans in an $\infty$-category $C$. Applying a theorem stated by Lurie in [33], such topological field theories are classified by Calabi-Yau algebras in \(\operatorname\{Span\}(C)\). We define two 1-categories whose functors to $C$ parameterize, respectively, associative algebras and Calabi-Yau algebras in \(\operatorname\{Span\}(C)\). We prove that there is an equivalence of $\infty$-categories between associative algebras in Span(C) and 2-Segal simplicial objects in $C$; and we prove an equivalence of $\infty$-categories between Calabi-Yau algebras in \(\operatorname\{Span\}(C)\) and 2-Segal cyclic objects in $C$. We discuss the invariants the resultant topological field theories assign to surfaces, and develop the example provided by cyclic structures on Cech nerves.},

	shorttitle = {2-Cartesian Fibrations I},
	abstract = {In this paper, we provide a notion of $\infty$-bicategories fibred in $\infty$-bicategories which we call 2-Cartesian fibrations. Our definition is formulated using the language of marked biscaled simplicial sets: Those are scaled simplicial sets equipped with an additional collection of triangles containing the scaled 2-simplices, which we call lean triangles, in addition to a collection of edges containing all degenerate 1-simplices.  We prove the existence of a left proper combinatorial simplicial model category whose fibrant objects are precisely the 2-Cartesian fibrations over a chosen scaled simplicial set $S$. Over the terminal scaled simplicial set, this provides a new model structure modeling $\infty$-bicategories, which we show is Quillen equivalent to Lurie’s scaled simplicial set model. We conclude by providing a characterization of 2-Cartesian fibrations over an $\infty$-bicategory. This characterization then allows us to identify those 2-Cartesian fibrations arising as the coherent nerve of a fibration of \(\operatorname{Set}_\Delta\)-enriched categories, thus showing that our definition recovers the preexisting notions of fibred 2-categories.},

This results in a classification of 2-dimensional open closed field theories in terms of algebraic structures we term “knowledgeable $\Lambda_r$-Frobenius algebras”. We additionally extend the state sum construction of closed r-spin {TFTs} from a $\Lambda_r$-Frobenius algebra A with invertible window element of Novak and Runkel-Szegedy to the open-closed case.
